Folder cs6301/g27 contents:

1. DFS.java - Q1
	Given a directed graph G, the algorithm uses DFS to return a list of nodes in the topological order if the graph is a DAG, otherwise returns null.

2. TopologicalOrdering.java	- Q1
	Given a directed graph G, the algorithm returns a list of nodes ordered topologically by removing vertices with zero incoming edges and their incident
	edges, if the graph G is a DAG, otherwise returns null.

3. TopologicalDriver.java - Q1 - [RUN]
	Accept a direct graph G and outputs the vertices in the topological order using the above two algorithms if the graph G is a DAG.

4. SCC.java - Q2 - [RUN]
	Given a directed graph G returns the number of strongly connected components of G.

5. Eulerian.java - Q3 - [RUN]
	Given a directed graph G tests whether G is Eulerian.

6. DAG.Java - Q4 - [RUN]
	Given a directed graph G tests whether G is a directed acyclic graph.
