Folder cs6301/g27 contents:

1. SetOperations.java - Q1 - [RUN]
	Given two linked lists implementing sorted sets, static functions for union, intersection, and set difference of the sets.

2. SinglyLinkedList.java - Q3, Q4 - [RUN]
	Methods -
		multiUnzip( int ) 			- Rearrange elements of the singly linked list by chaining together elements that are k apart.
		iterativeReverse() 			- Reverse the elements of the SLL iteratively
		recursiveReverse() 			- Reverse the SLL recursively
		recursiveReverse( Entry<T> ) 		- Helper function for resursive reversal
		printReverse() 				- Print the elements of the SLL iteratively in the reverse order
		printReverseRecursive() 		- Print the elements of the SLL recursively in the reverse order
		printReverseRecursive( Entry<T> ) 	- Helper function for recursive reverse printing

3. BoundedQueue.java - Q5 - [RUN]
	An array-based, bounded-sized queues, that support the following operations: offer, poll, peek, isEmpty (same behavior as in Java's Queue interface).

4. BoundedStack.java - Q6 - [RUN]
	An array-based, bounded-sized stacks.

5. Token.java
	Represents a token in a mathematical expression.

6. ShuntingYard.java - Q8 - [RUN]
	Contains static method to convert an infix expression with each token separated by space to postfix expression by using the Shunting Yard Algorithm.

7. Polynomial.java
	A Polynomial equation represented by a Linked List of Polynomial Terms ordered by the exponent value.

8. SparsePolynomialOperations.java - Q9 - [RUN]
	Arithmetic with sparse polynomials, implementing the following operations: addition, multiplication, evaluation.
